# TKT-0138: Orphaned claims review — a standing queue to assign owners to subject-less claims

## Context

Grouping Lore evidence by owning record (2026-09-21) exposed a population of claims with no `subject_entity_id` — they land in the "No owning record" group. Sean's read on the live data: **many belong somewhere obvious** (an entity that already exists), and **some don't** — history/lore claims that may legitimately have no owner, or belong to records that don't exist yet. Before the grouping, this residue was invisible; the identity review (TKT-0106) closed 91% claim coverage and this queue addresses the remainder. Per the standing productize rule, this is a permanent in-app review feature, not a one-time backfill.

## Scope when taken up

- **Core list endpoint**: subject-less claims (`subject_entity_id IS NULL`, non-superseded), each with assertion text, state, authority, sources, and **suggested owners** — deterministic suggestions from the existing co-mention / alias / word-index machinery (the link-audit and entity-lookup tooling), ranked; no suggestion is authoritative.
- **The bridge to Lore is the primary migration path** (user ruling 2026-09-21): the review is a list of orphaned claims that can be **checked and migrated into the Lore creation queue**. Checked claims become a seeded Lore queue item — the DM names the record they belong to (defaulting to the top suggested owner's name when one exists); the claims ride along as pre-loaded evidence in that item's working file, Consider-checked and ready to Link. Lore then handles both resolutions it already owns: create the new entity and take the claims under it, or match an existing entity via the link-target flow and Link to it. The orphans find their owner through the same reviewed door everything else uses.
- **Initial attribution write** — LANDED early (migrations 0067+0068, harness-tested): `move_claim_subject` accepts a NULL old owner with nullable `old_entity_id` receipts, and the re-attribution service/API handle the initial case. Receipted, reason required, provenance untouched; the claim's text/state/evidence never change, only ownership. Lore's Link path uses this for orphans the same way it uses re-attribution for owned claims.
- **Direct assign-to-record** stays available for the obvious cases (owner exists, no Lore ceremony needed): a suggested owner or searched record as the initial-attribution target.
- **"No owner needed" disposition**: some claims are ambient history/lore with no owning record. A receipted per-claim disposition (reason required, audited like candidate dispositions) that removes the claim from the review without inventing an entity — "missing source files never authorize automatic canonical deletion," and neither does a missing owner.
- **Tools-panel review queue** (link-audit pattern): rows show the claim (Truth State + authority chips, expandable text, source excerpt) with its suggested owners; actions = **Migrate checked to Lore queue** (primary) / **Assign to record** / **No owner needed** (reason required); re-runnable, so future unowned claims reappear — a standing review, not a batch.
- Per-item dispositions only: inspecting one claim never decides another; migration carries exactly the checked claims.
- Optional later (out of scope unless ruled in): the AI Promotion Assistant suggesting owners on this queue (TKT-0137 seam 4 — suggest subjects).

## Sean's priority ruling (2026-09-28) — this is the front

"Dealing with data that exists but is unassigned and thus mostly invisible is much more relevant than an Entity that has no non-Attribute Claims. Writing prose for Entities is a baseline purpose of this app and thus has no end." Consequences recorded: the orphan queue outranks Q1 zero-claim completion (which is baseline ongoing usage, not a finite campaign — TKT-0140 closed on this ruling); today NO surface lists the orphans (the only `subject_entity_id IS NULL` query in the codebase is an internal duplicate check; audit Q3 reports pending; Step 1's document-exclusive slice reaches only a few dozen of them). Live population: **186 non-superseded ownerless claims** (206 at discovery on 09-21; ~20 consumed via Step 1 Assign Ownership).

## Already landed since the ticket was written

- **The initial-attribution write path is DONE** (was an open scope item): migrations 0067+0068 extended `move_claim_subject` to a NULL old owner with nullable `old_entity_id` receipts; the re-attribution service and API handle it; harness-tested. The queue builds on a working write.
- **Step 1 Assign Ownership** (0140) consumed the document-exclusive slice and validated the UX (checked rows → one button → receipted attribution → re-audit).
- **The Lore working item persists evidence through refresh** (ADR-0019), so seeded orphans ride safely.

## Fold-in: the audit's Q5 flip

While touching the qualified audit for Q3, flip **Q5 (`q5_attributes_minted`) from pending to computed** — minting landed (TKT-0143, migrations 0069/0070, live 36 bindings across 19 profiles) but the audit still reports "pending claim-backed minting (TKT-0143)". Same file, same pattern: Q5 = every attribute-bearing profile's fields have a minted claim behind them (or the profile predates minting and carries the unanchored-but-dated backfill marker). Q3 flips to computed with this ticket's dispositions ("no owner needed" receipts + clean ownership); Q5 is a mechanical join against `attribute_claim_bindings`.

## Open at ticket time — the obvious-home path (user ruling 2026-09-21: defer)

The Lore bridge is right for orphans with NO obvious home. Orphans WITH an obvious home need their own solution — maybe still Lore (workspace built up to accommodate seeded resolution against existing records), maybe the Library's built-in entry editor (the page that already owns the record, per ADR-0016 every-page-editable). The tension: two editing homes (Lore workspace vs Library entry editors) and where an obvious-home attribution belongs. Decide when this ticket is worked; do not pre-commit.

## Out of scope

- Auto-assignment or bulk approval — every attribution is an explicit DM decision.
- Creating entities directly from this queue — creation goes through Lore (that is the bridge); the queue itself links and queues, it doesn't author.
- Changing claim text, state, or evidence — ownership only.
